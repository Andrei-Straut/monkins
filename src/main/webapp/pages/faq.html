        <h1>Jenkins Monitor FAQ</h1>

        <h2>What's the significance of the colors?</h2>
        <div>Color codes follow the Jenkins conventions, meaning:
            <ul>
                <li>Green is for successful jobs (jobs that have completed successfully, or, in the case of test jobs, jobs who have completed 
                    successfully with tests passed)</li>
                <li>Yellow is for jobs that are currently unstable</li>
                <li>Red is for jobs that have failed, whether due to job errors, or test failures</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Why are some jobs' titles fading in and out?</h2>
        <div>
            Job titles fading in and out means that the job is currently running. Background color is the status of the last completed build, and
            becomes automatically updated upon job completion.
        </div>

        <h2>Why are some jobs white?</h2>
        <div>
            White is undefined (default) status. If a job's color is white, is because there was an error retrieving its data.
        </div>

        <h2>Why in some cases I correctly see <i>Last Successful</i>, <i>Last Failed</i> and <i>Test Results</i> data, and in others not?</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                By default, these details are only reported for failed or unstable builds, as there is no immediate necessity to always check
                details for a build that is going well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, this depends on how your Jenkins reports data. Things may vary due to versions, or in the case of <i>Last Successful</i>
                or <i>Last Failed</i> fields, the data may simply not be available (i.e. there was never a successful or failed build). Absence 
                of test result data is particularly common for build jobs, who may simply execute the build process, without running tests in and
                of themselves.
            </p>
        </div>
